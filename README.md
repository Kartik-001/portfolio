## 🚀 About Me

I specialize in **Artificial Intelligence** and **Machine Learning**, with hands-on experience building deep learning models from the ground up. My journey so far includes:

- Building a **Baby GPT-2** in PyTorch to understand transformer internals  
- Crafting a **custom BPE tokenizer** like OpenAI’s `tiktoken`  
- Designing adaptive agents for decision-making in complex environments  
- Integrating AI into hardware for autonomous drones, underwater robots, and delivery bots  

I aim to deliver production-ready solutions that are **future-proof**, **ethically guided**, and **impactful**.
