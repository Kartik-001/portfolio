## Hi, I’m Kartik Lodhi 👋

I’m a **Computer Science B.Tech graduate** with a passion for building AI/ML systems that solve real‑world problems. Over the past few years, I’ve:

* Developed **Baby GPT‑2 from Scratch** in PyTorch—complete with a custom BPE tokenizer and beam search inference.
* Designed and engineered autonomous agents capable of planning and learning from their environment.
* Integrated AI into robotics hardware—drones, delivery bots, and underwater probes.

My journey into data science and AI began during my undergrad, when I realized the power of machine learning to extract stories from raw data. Since then, I’ve honed my skills in Python, PyTorch, NumPy, and data visualization, and I’m always exploring new tools and techniques to push the boundaries of what’s possible.

### 🎯 My Goals

* **Deliver actionable insights** that help businesses make smarter decisions.
* **Build scalable ML pipelines** and autonomous systems that adapt and learn continuously.
* **Share knowledge** by writing tutorials, open‑sourcing my projects, and contributing to the community.
